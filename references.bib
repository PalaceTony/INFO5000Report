%      General comments about citations in LaTeX
%---------------------------------------------------

% BibTex (bibliography style used in this document) is pretty sensitive for wrong citation formats
% The easiest way to avoid mistakes, and my personal way to go, is to add all your sources to a citation manager (Mendeley, Zotero etc) and export from there as bibtex code.
% If you do decide to do it by yourself the following applies:
% - There are different types of things that can be citated (@article, @book, @misc, etc.). All require different fields to be filled in. Check the documentation before creating too many errors (CTAN bibtex)
% - In general Authors need to be seperated by 'and'
% - A comma for the authors indicates that the format is <lastname>,<firstname>
